            Shrimp linguine is a delicious pasta dish featuring tender shrimp tossed with linguine noodles in a flavorful sauce. The sauce is typically made from a rich combination of olive oil, garlic, white wine, and a touch of lemon, often finished with fresh parsley for an added burst of freshness. Some variations may include a creamy base with heavy cream or a spicy kick with red pepper flakes. This dish is a perfect balance of savory, citrusy, and slightly garlicky flavors, making it a delightful seafood pasta choice.
