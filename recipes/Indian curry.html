        <p>Here are the steps:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with <strong>2 teaspoons</strong> salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.</li>
                <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, <strong>1 tablespoon</strong> chopped cilantro, and <strong>1 teaspoon</strong> salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about <strong>20 minutes</strong>. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <strong> 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</strong>. Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
            
            
            
            </ol>
